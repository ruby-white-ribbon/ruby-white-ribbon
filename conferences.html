      This list intends to provide information about the availability of a
      Code of Conduct at Ruby conferences, or other approaches taken in order
      to help provide a safe and comfortable experience to everyone at the
      conference.

    <p>
      Conferences listed here are <strong>not</strong> affiliated with the Ruby
      White Ribbon campaign. This list is a simple collection of information
      available on conference websites or given via email.

      <p>
        We believe every conference should have a Code of Conduct and
        information about the presence of a Code of Conduct will be valuable
        to conference attendees, speakers and organizers.
