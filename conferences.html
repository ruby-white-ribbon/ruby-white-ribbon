      <p>
        We believe every conference should have a Code of Conduct and we think information about the presence
        of a Code of Conduct will be valuable information to both conference attendees and speakers.

        The data above is pulled from the great project <a href="http://rubyconferences.org">RubyConferences.org</a>

        We re-publish and add onto the data from <a href="http://rubyconferences.org">RubyConferences.org</a> here
        because we believe an overview of the presence of a Code of Conduct at Ruby conferences is valuable
        information, but the maintainers of RubyConferences.org have chosen to not add it to their
        <a href="https://github.com/ruby-conferences/ruby-conferences-site/issues/13">list</a>.

        to the <a href="https://github.com/ruby-conferences/ruby-conferences-site">RubyConferences.org repository</a>.
        If you find any information about the presence of a Code of Conduct missing or out of date, please file an issue
